    // This is meant to prevent a bug in SwiftUI involving the toolbar in full-screen mode. For Advance, when the
    // unified toolbar is hidden in full-screen mode and the user selects "Customize Toolbar...", it temporarily appears.
    // However, when the customize modal is dismissed, SwiftUI does not hide the toolbar, resulting in it persisting
    // until the user exits full-screen mode.
    //
    // The solution presented here checks if the window is full-screened and visible, and, if so, hides the toolbar.
    // It's likely inefficient, given this delegate method is called very often; however, it does solve our problem.
